Milestone 3 - Deployment
===========


**Team Members :**

### Application

We are creating a Bucket List web application using Python flask framework and sqllite3 as the database.

We are using Jenkins for continous integration.

### Properties
---

####Task 1: Configuration Management
We are using [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro.html) to automatically configure our production environment.

The provisioning is done on Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The playbook used for the provisioning can be accessed from [here.](https://github.com/Shraddha512/M3-Deployment/blob/master/playbook.yml)

The playbook provisions the following components:
* Git
* Redis
* gcc compiler
* make and tar utilities
* Sqlite 3 database
* Python and its packages.
* Nodejs

#### Task 2: Deployment to Production Environment

The Build steps and the Testing and Analysis steps are performed first.

<h4>Build</h4>
A Jenkins job (mentioned below in this section) is triggered on committing to the GitHub repository.

<h4>Testing and Analysis</h4>
* The python package nose is the unit-testing framework used. It generates reports in a format which the [Cobertura](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin) plugin understands and this plugin is used to display the results in a graphical format.
* The pylint package is used for static code analysis. The results generated by this plugin is displayed using the 
 [Violations](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations) Jenkins plugin.

Once these steps are successfully completed, the Deployment phase begins.

<h4>Deployment</h4>

* The steps for Deployment are included in a file named [launch.sh](https://github.com/Shraddha512/M3-Deployment/blob/master/launch.sh). We run this script through our Jenkins shell.

* We are using [AWS Code Deploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets for this step. We deploy our code on [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) Linux instances.

Step1: We have two Jenkins jobs: 
1. PythonM1Build which builds the production branch and deploys the code to two instances.
2. CanaryRelease which builds the dev branch and deploys on subset of the two instances (one instance).

Step2: Jenkins uses [AWS Code Deploy plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codedeploy-plugin) to zip the latest pushed code and send it to the S3 bucket.

Step3: S3 bucket "milestone3shraddha" holds the various versions of code pushed by jenkins job.

Step4: AWS Code Deploy pulls the latest code from S3 bucket and deploys it. We have two Groups:
1. ProdDeploy : Deploys to two instances.
2. Canary : Deploys to one of the two instances.

The following are the steps during deployment:

#### Task 3:Feature Flags
* To enable the usage of Feature Flags, we use [Redis](http://redis.io/) as the in-memory database store.
* The deployed application has the following feature which can be toggled on/off:
  * Setting the flag on redis-cli will change the font color of our deployed application as shown below:
![Font Color changed](https://github.com/Shraddha512/M3-Deployment/blob/master/images/redis.png)

  * Unsetting the flag on redis-cli will change the font color of our deployed application to the one shown below:

#### Task 4:Monitoring

We are performing monitoring on our instances based on two metrics : CPU usage and Memory usage: 

The file for the code of monitoring is present [here.](https://github.com/Shraddha512/M3-Deployment/blob/master/main.js).

![Output](https://github.com/Shraddha512/M3-Deployment/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-17%20at%2010.20.08%20PM.png)

An alert is sent as soon as the threshold values specified for the metrics are exceeded.

#### Task 5: Canary Release
*(Please note that the proxy server logs are visible in the bottom right, and canary server in the top right in the following screenshots)*

The proxy server redirects 70% of the requests to the main server.

30% of the requests (chosen randomly) are redirected by the proxy to the canary deployment.

If an alert is raised by the server running the canary deployment, the proxy redirects all subsequent requests to the main server.
